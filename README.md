# RLSDSPCA

## (I) Datasets
Three different types of gene expression data including Cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) from TCGA. The CHOL dataset includes 45 samples (9 normal samples, 36 cancer samples), 20502 genes; the HNSCC dataset consists of 418 samples (20 normal samples, 398 cancer samples), 20502 genes; the PAAD dataset contains 180 samples, 20502 genes (4 normal samples, 176 cancer samples). The number of genes in the gene expression data of the three different cancer types is same, we integrate the three types of gene expression data in the sample direction to form a multi-source gene expression data that have four categories (normal samples and three different types of cancer samples).
The datasets of gene expression for characteristic gene selection and tumor classification were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) database.
